## The Algorithm

This project uses a retrained Resnet-18 model trained on images of 38 different wild animals. The program takes an input image and feeds it to the retrained model; the model then uses its training to deduce what animal it believes to be in the image and the result is printed out.

## Running this project

1. ssh into your jetson-nano and make sure you have jetson-inference installed
2. TBD
